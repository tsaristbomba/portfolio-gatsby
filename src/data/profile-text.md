I was born and grew up in Brazil, in a small town at the exact center of [the great state of Bahia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Bandeira_da_Bahia.svg/1920px-Bandeira_da_Bahia.svg.png) 😁. My experience with computers started when my parents, both high school teachers, needed a computer to work. They bought a white IBM Windows 98 PC, which I played games and learned a lot from,
enjoyed every second of it. Knowing that I would end up working in tech wasn't a stretch 😉.

As time passes I started to study Computer Engineering to after find out that coding itself is what suits me more, so I made the change to Computer Science. In the meantime I was learning Web Development and started making games and websites for fun, to later decide to do this professionally, and here I am 🖐️.

My other big passions are Music, Crypto and Games. As described before, I started coding building games as well as websites, and to this day gaming is a big passion of mine. While doing anything I like to listen to a lot of music, and this are some of my favorite [Playlists](https://telfer.io/playlists/) at the moment.
