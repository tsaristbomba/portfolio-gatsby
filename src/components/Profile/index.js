              . My experience with computers started when my parents, both high
              school teachers, needed a computer to work. They bought a white
              IBM Windows 98 PC, which I played games and learned a lot from,

              Development and started making games and websites for fun, to
              later decide to do this professionally, and here I am{" "}

              before, I started coding building games as well as websites, and
